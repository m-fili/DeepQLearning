## 1. Introduction
In this project I trained an agent using Deep Q-learning (DQN) to collect an average of +13 
yellow bananas in 100 consecutive episodes. The DQN algorithm used here, applies experience replay to remove 
correlation between consecutive tuple experiences, and help the algorithm remember rare events.
I also used fixed target in this algorithm to help it converge.

## 2. Q-network
The model used to estimate the q-values for different actions is a multi-layer perceptron with 
two hidden layers, each with 64 nodes and Relu activation functions. The output layer has 4 
nodes (each corresponding to one of the actions 1 to 4), and an identity activation function.
To optimize the weights, I used Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0005.

n_episodes = 1800, min_epsilon = 0.05, epsilon_decay = 0.995, 
        t_max = 10, epsilon = 1.0, update_target_frequency = 10, 
        update_main_frequency = 2




### 4. Test for 100 Episodes
The trained agent is evaluated on 100 episodes and the the output is shown
in the figure below:
